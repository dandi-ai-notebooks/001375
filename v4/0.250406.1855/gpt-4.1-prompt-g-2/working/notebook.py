# ## Summarizing available NWB files
#
# For illustration, we focus on a single NWB file:
#
# ```
# sub-MS13B/sub-MS13B_ses-20240725T190000_ecephys.nwb
# ```
# [Neurosift: visualize this file](https://neurosift.app/nwb?url=https://api.dandiarchive.org/api/assets/ce525828-8534-4b56-9e47-d2a34d1aa897/download/&dandisetId=001375&dandisetVersion=draft)
#
# **Experimental context:**  
# In this experiment, a chemogenetic technique (DREADD—Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs) was used to suppress GABAergic (inhibitory) neurons specifically in the medial septum of the mouse brain. This manipulation is expected to influence neural activity in downstream regions like the hippocampus and neocortex.  
# The "trials" in this dataset likely represent individual laps or runs performed by the mouse, aligning with behavioral events.
#
# Asset ID: `ce525828-8534-4b56-9e47-d2a34d1aa897`
#
# We will load and analyze this file using the remote URL:
# ```

# ## Load NWB file and survey its structure
#
# We use PyNWB and remfile to stream the file from the DANDI API without downloading.  
# The NWB (Neurodata Without Borders) standard organizes neurophysiology data in a hierarchical file structure. Main components and their relationships are outlined below.

# ### Main structures in this NWB file

# %% [markdown]
# **NWB File Structure Overview:**  
# NWB organizes data hierarchically. Key relationships in this file:
#
# - `acquisition/time_series`: raw extracellular signals (main voltage signals); shape is (samples, channels)
# - `electrodes` table: describes properties and locations of each physical channel
# - `units` table: stores spike trains for sorted neurons (units), referencing spike times
# - `trials` table: behavioral epochs such as laps/runs (start/stop times)
# - `subject`: experiment subject metadata (species, age, interventions)
#
# | Structure          | Description                                                  | Size / Content            |
# |--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
# | acquisition/time_series | Raw extracellular voltage traces                    | (144,675,584, 256) int16  |
# | electrodes         | Metadata for 256 electrodes                                 | Table: (256, x7 cols)     |
# | trials             | Start/stop time for laps/trials (behavior)                  | 387 laps                  |
# | units              | Sorted spike trains (times per unit)                        | 33 units                  |
# | subject            | Mouse info (ID, species, age, DREADD, etc)                  | MS13B, M, P90D            |

# ## Visualization: Raw extracellular voltage traces
#
# Let's plot a snippet (first 1 s) of the raw voltage from the first 4 channels.  
# **Note:** Only a small segment is loaded, for illustration. All signals are in millivolts (mV).
#
# _Performance tip:_ For large NWB datasets, stream only windows or subsets of the data to avoid loading all samples into memory.

# %%
# Plot raw data snippet for 4 channels, 1 s, with offsets
rate = ts.rate  # 30000 Hz
n_channels = 4
duration_s = 1.0
n_samples = int(rate * duration_s)
# Only loading a submatrix to avoid memory overflow
data = ts.data[:n_samples, :n_channels] * ts.conversion  # shape (n_samples, n_channels)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
spacing = 600
for ch in range(n_channels):
    # Each trace is vertically offset for clarity
    plt.plot(np.arange(n_samples) / rate, data[:, ch] + ch * spacing, label=f'Ch {ch+1}')
plt.xlabel('Time (s)')
plt.ylabel('Voltage + offset (mV)')
plt.title('Extracellular traces: 4 channels, first 1 s')
plt.legend()
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# %% [markdown]
# **Interpretation:**  
# The traces above show typical neural voltage fluctuations. Individual action potentials (spikes) may not be visually prominent at this scale, but the variability and baseline noise are plausible for extracellular hippocampal data.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Visualization: Spike times for sorted units
#
# Here we plot a raster (spike times per unit) for the first 5 units, for spike times less than 30 s.
# _This highlights variation in spike activity._

# %%
df_units = nwb.units.to_dataframe()
unit_ids = df_units.index[:5]
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4))
for i, unit_id in enumerate(unit_ids):
    spike_times = df_units.loc[unit_id, 'spike_times']
    # Only include spikes within the first 30 seconds for illustration
    spike_times = [t for t in spike_times if t < 30.0]
    # Draw spike events as vertical lines for each unit (row in the plot)
    plt.vlines(spike_times, i + 0.5, i + 1.5)
plt.yticks(range(1, 6), [f'Unit {x}' for x in unit_ids])
plt.xlabel('Time (s)')
plt.ylabel('Unit')
plt.title('Spike raster: first 5 units, spike times < 30 s')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# %% [markdown]
# **Interpretation:**  
# Each row corresponds to a different sorted unit (putative neuron). Vertical lines show spike times.  
# Notice that some units (e.g., Unit 3) are much more active, so spike times can visually merge—when spike events are dense, the raster may look saturated and not all individual spikes are distinguishable.  
# This plot provides a quick overview of spike train patterns for a handful of units.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Where to go from here
#
# - Explore across sessions and NWB files in this Dandiset.
# - Analyze patterns in spikes or local field potentials (LFPs) over trials or behavioral epochs.
# - Investigate trial start/stop times, align neural activity to trial events.
# - Map units and channels to anatomical location using the electrodes table.
# - Download NWB files for more in-depth analysis using local tools.
# - Try further visualization: peristimulus histograms, mean firing rates, cross-correlations, spectral analyses, etc.
